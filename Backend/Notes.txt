* The main difference between the two is the type of data they handle. express.json() is used for JSON data,
while express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) is used for urlencoded data.

* posts: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Post",
    },
  ]
In above code ref is optional using it improves the readability and understanding of the code. Later one can easiliy
understand that posts is an array of post refer to Post model.
